# Test Cases for DarazBD 

This project involves test case writing and exploratory testing performed on the DarazBD website (https://www.daraz.com.bd/). The primary objective was to validate each credential required to create a new user account and login. Additionally, exploratory testing was conducted, including the creation of a test plan, test matrix, and bug report.

## Project Overview

the manual testing project for the DarazBD website, focusing specifically on the login and signup pages. The project involves detailed test case writing and exploratory testing to ensure these critical user entry points are robust, secure, and user-friendly.




## Features

- **Test Scenerio Writing:** Test scenarios are broad and objective descriptions of functionality that can be tested.
- **Test Case Writing:** Test cases were written to verify various aspects of creating a new account and login on the DarazBD website, ensuring that each credential validation meets the required standards.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Includes the creation of a test plan, test matrix, and bug report to perform comprehensive exploratory testing.



## Testing Scope

- Login Page Testing: Includes testing for valid and invalid user credentials, user feedback on errors, password visibility toggle, and session persistence.
- Signup Page Testing: Focus on field validations, mandatory fields check, user feedback on successful or failed registration, and password strength indicator.
## Tools Required

- Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel: To document test cases and outcomes.
- Various Browsers and Devices: To test cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness on different devices.
## Test Case Development

Test cases will be developed to cover:

- `Standard Operation Procedures:` Normal usage scenarios where the user inputs correct and expected information.
- `Boundary Conditions:` Test data at the edge of acceptability.
- `Negative Testing:` Inputting data that should be rejected or cause errors to ensure proper handling of such cases.

Each test case will include:

- **Test Case ID**
- **Test Scenerio**
- **Test Case Title**
- **Pre-Conditions**
- **Test Steps**
- **Test Data**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result**
- **Result** (Pass/Fail)

## Exploratory Testing

### Test Plan

A test plan was created to outline the testing approach, objectives, scope, resources, and schedule for the testing process.

### Usage

- Access the DarazBD website (https://www.daraz.com.bd/).
- Execute the written test cases to validate each credential required for account creation and login.
- Perform exploratory testing as per the created test plan and document findings in the test matrix and bug report.

### Notes

Ensure thorough execution of written test cases to validate the account creation process. Document any bugs, anomalies, or issues encountered during exploratory testing.
